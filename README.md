# Periodic-Table
A deck for Anki to learn the Periodic Table. Each Element has cards matching Element Name, Atomic Number, Atomic Mass, Group, Period, Classification and Electronic Configuration with each other.

Notes are also tagged if you wish to selectively learn some together. Synthetic and Synthetically Discovered tags were added as I felt too lazy too make them into proper cards, and as they didn't make that much sense to me anyways.
